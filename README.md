@ItzARubix here, though many of you may know me better as ChillSpider
I'm not really a programmer, my knowledge on programming is surprisingly limited. 
I'm currently working on several projects at once, though not many of them are stored on GitHub. Most of them I store locally.
I'm a streamer and Twitch affiliate, and that's where I'm most active. If you need to contact me, or just want to say hi, head to https://www.twitch.tv/chillspider123 and tell me you came from here!
I play video games, more recently I've been playing some FromSoftware games like Sekiro, Bloodborne, and DS3, but I'm interested in a lot of other games and genres as well!
I'm a student, currently learning Geometry (though, this may be outdated by the time you find it... I'll need to update it every so often)
If you need to contact me for any reason or you want to help me on any projects that I'm working on, head over to my Twitch channel and from there to my Discord server.
