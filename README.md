Currently reading: Introduction to Topological Manifolds by John M. Lee (Finished The Lost Metal by Brandon Sanderson and now I just don't have the motivation to start anything new in terms of fiction). 

On the queue: 
1. Elantris
2. Arcanum Unbounded (I've already read Edgedancer, Eleventh Metal, Secret History, and maybe a few others, but the rest of AU I still need to read)
3. Secret Project 1 

So, I should start by saying that I'm not a programmer, or a CS enthusiast, or anything of the sort. Not anymore, anyways. I'm a physics student, an academic. I also do a lot of writing, both creative and video-essay-like. 

So, I think about a lot of stuff. And I don't like it when the stuff I think about just stays in my head. I want to talk about it, and I want other people to hear about it. Since I don't live alone, recording video essays is... challenging. So I store all this stuff here until I find a way to use it. 

Oh yeah, if I *do* ever choose to program something, I'll post it here, too. 

I read a lot of Brandon Sanderson, and so you can expect some of the stuff I talk about here to be related to that. 

Also I do a lot of physics, as I mentioned earlier, so I'll probably include a lot of that stuff here, too. 

Beyond that, what I'll talk about will probably be just... stuff that I was thinking about. Sometimes, I find weird, obscure pieces of internet trivia that I want to share, and so I'll post them here. 

Stick around if you want, don't if you don't. 

It's a hard world out there. Stay strong, soldier. Know that, no matter how hard it is, there will be better times. <3
