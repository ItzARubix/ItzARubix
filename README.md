I find my current predicament to be quite strange. Frustrating, yes, but strange nevertheless. My hindrances are not ones of Shards, but of common men. Perhaps that's what makes my inability to escape them so frustrating.

But I am a scholar at heart. Indeed, although I have found difficulty in being unable to communicate with friends, a more pragmatic difficulty is my inability to communicate with my fellow scholars. Without that communication, verifying my findings becomes impossible.
