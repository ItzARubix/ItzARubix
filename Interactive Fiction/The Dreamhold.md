I have a lot to say about Interactive Fiction. It's a rabbit hole that I've only fallen farther and farther down into. 

I love Interactive Fiction, and it's a shame that it's such a forgotten genre. I've tried making Interactive Fiction before, but have never been successful. 

If you've never played a Text Adventure game before, I recommend https://eblong.com/zarf/zweb/dreamhold/

The game has so many secrets and mysteries. I think if it was more popular, it was the kind of thing that MatPat would make a theory video on.

So go on, get lost in the game. Find some mysteries. Use hints if you need to. The true ending of the game requires you to complete all the hidden puzzles (the game calls them "side quests," but they don't feel like traditional side quests. They aren't given to you by an NPC or through some note on the ground, as you're completely alone in this game. They're optional little mysteries and secrets that you can find). There are seven, and once you actually find them all, figuring out the true ending takes some extra work as well. I'll admit that I had to use a guide to get this one, as the game does not give you hints for the true ending, it only gives you hints for the puzzles required for the main endings (Of which there are two). 

Finally.png (in this very folder) is simply a screenshot of me finally getting the true ending of the game. Like I said, I did use a guide (If you want the link: http://www.plover.net/~davidw/sol/dreamhold.html) but when I did get the ending, I still got chills. So many secrets. Considering I played this game back in middle school, it was... exciting... to finally get the true ending. I'm happy. I'm proud. 

The game makes little effort to explain its lore to you. Wearing the masks that you find throughout the game gives you small flashbacks, but you're ultimately left to put the pieces of the puzzle together yourself (a task which I have been unsuccessful in doing). The game has a few red herrings, (I can think of three or so off the top of my head) but most of the items you get throughout the game are used in some way (even if it's for one of the optional puzzles mentioned earlier). 

Perhaps, when I have the time, I'll make a more full document about all the weird, branching rabbit holes that I found as I dug deeper into this forgotten genre. Until then, go play the game. Go beat the game. And while you're at it, shoot the creator an email. Who knows? Maybe it's still active and he'll respond.
